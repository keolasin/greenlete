**Greenlete**

This is an app for athletes interested in sustainability to track their workouts and the litter they pick up in their communities to and from those workouts - it's focus is to raise awareness of the large amounts of non-recyclables produced by corporations that winds up in our neighborhoods and to empower individuals to be active not only physically, but active in their communities too.

This app was built using Node, Express, React, and a PostgreSQL database.
